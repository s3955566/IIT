				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>My family have been in Australia for about five generations, with most of my Australian ancestors originally coming here from the UK and Ireland; though my heritage is not entirely European, one of my great grandfathers arrived in Australia from Barbados.</p>
          <p>
            Subjects during my completion of the Higher School Certificate consisted of Music, Biology, Advanced English, Mathematics, and Physics.
            From high school I went straight into a Bachelor of Accounting course at Western Sydney University, where I since have also studied parts of both the Bachelor of ICT and the Bachelor of Cyber Security and Behaviour.
            In between my studies at university, I have also completed a Certificate IV in Accounting and Bookkeeping. Currently I am still working towards completing a university level qualification, though now I am with RMIT, a far more specialised and renowned institution.
          </p>
          <p>During my downtime I have been known to enjoy strategy games and occasionally take part in trading card tournaments; though I spend just as much time analysing data and developing strategies outside of the games as I do with the games themselves.</p>

            Computing technology has always fascinated me.
            Even during my first experiences with a computer I was enthralled by the power at my fingertips and the possibilities of what such technology could be capable of.
            For most of my life I viewed the field of IT as something that will always be outside of my capabilities, something I could deeply appreciate but never be a part of.
            It was not until I started to learn about programming and networking that I realised it was not only possible, but something that comes more naturally to me than it does for most.
            Since realising how well my strengths align with the work of the IT industry, I have been trying to carve my path to a career in the field.
          </p>
          <p>
            Melbourne, to me, seems like Australia’s capital of technology and forward-thinking approaches.
            When I found the opportunity to join the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology through online study, I knew it would be a big step in the right direction for finding a career in IT; so far, my experiences with RMIT have only reinforced that idea.
          </p>
          <p>I trust that during my time studying with RMIT I will develop a wide variety of skills and knowledge that not just relate to the IT industry but are core practical aspects of working in the field.</p>

					<h2><a href="Machine Learning Engineer (NLP) Job in Sydney - SEEK.pdf">Machine Learning Engineer (NLP)</a></h2>
					<h3>Description</h3>
					<p>
            As a software engineer working to develop an AI mental health therapist through natural language processing and deep learning, this role would be an opportunity to build towards advancing the applications of artificial intelligence in ways that could directly help humanity.
            Mental health is a growing concern in our modern world and contributing the development of conversational AI that could provide help to those in need at any time they need it could be a revolutionary step in treating the growing cases of mental illness in our culture.
            For many, of the most difficult parts of getting help with mental illness is reaching out or having to wait for expensive appointments where many feel that they did not get a chance to talk through everything they wanted to.
            It would be a dream come true to be a part of what one day could become the source of help that countless people around the world need but cannot yet access with the current systems in place.
          </p>
					<h3>Required Skills</h3>
					<p>
            To be considered for a role such as this, one would require extensive knowledge and experience regarding deep learning, conversational AI, full-stack development, and an impressive portfolio of related projects.
            In terms of qualifications, at the very least a bachelor’s degree in computer science or a related field would be necessary.
            Ideally one would have higher qualifications with a focus on artificial intelligence.
          </p>
					<h3>Applicable Skills</h3>
					<p>
            Still early in my journey into IT and software development, my relevant skills and experiences are limited.
            At this stage what I have to offer for a role like this would be my fluency with the English language, basic knowledge of some relevant programming languages (Python, Java, SQL), my attention to detail while also understanding the bigger picture, and my passion for the subject keeping me up to date with trends and advancements in the technology.
          </p>
					<h3>Learning Plan</h3>
					<p>
            After completing my Bachelor of IT and finding an entry point to a career in the field, I could continue my studies while working and progress towards a more advanced qualification.
            During such time it would be in my interest to look for AI related software development jobs available to someone with my level of skills and experience at the time.

				<h1>Personality Profile</h1>

            <h2>Myers Briggs Type Indicator - INTP</h2>
          </a>
          <p class="subDetails">
            <a href="https://www.16personalities.com">16Personalities.com</a>
          </p>
					<p>
            The Logician personality type is known for its tendency to explore and perhaps over-explore complex thoughts and ideas.
            Always thinking about something, the Logicians are constantly analysing past experiences, internally contemplating both sides of an argument, and pondering abstract ideas or possibilities.
          </p>
					<h3>Strengths</h3>
					<p>
            Logicians are great at spotting patterns or discrepancies that others may overlook, and their tendency to explore various abstract ideas can result in methods or approaches that may appear counterintuitive or unusual at first but may also prove to be a new or innovative solution.
            Being driven by a sense of curiosity also means being receptive to new ideas and suggestions from others if they have sound reasoning.
            Valuing logic and information above ideologies also pushes the Logician personality type to oppose misinformation and find the truth, helping them to build an understanding of what is truly happening in a situation.
          </p>
					<h3>Weaknesses</h3>
					<p>
            Being lost in thought is common for those who spend a lot of time thinking; this can result in Logicians having trouble keeping up with conversations at times when they have a lot on their mind as exploring ideas internally makes it more difficult to be receptive of what others are saying at the time.
            Their logical nature can also appear insensitive to others even when intending to display kindness, subconsciously undervaluing the importance of irrational etiquette or tradition.
            Possibly the most debilitating weakness of the Logician personality type is how difficult it is for them to be satisfied with their work, always imagining ways it could be better and paying too much attention to minute details that could be improved even though the project serves its purpose perfectly fine.
          </p>
					<h3>Team Composition</h3>
					<p>
            While Logicians are rarely interested in small talk, it is extremely valuable for them to be part of a group where they can be exposed to new ideas or opposed on their own so that they may further explore and refine what they have been working on or thinking about.
            A Logician will want to know what others in the group think or feel about ideas brought forward, and given their open-mindedness are not known for pushing their own ideas if objectively better or more feasible concepts are being presented.

            <li>Tactile: 30%</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This quiz suggests that I am an “Auditory” learner, though while it may be true that I have a slightly easier time recalling sounds than other forms of input my results were about as balanced as it could get.
            I am inclined to conclude that I, like most people, learn best from a variety of methods and styles instead of focusing on any specific type.

					<h2>Big Five Personality Test</h2>
          <p class="subDetails">
            <a href="https://www.truity.com/test/big-five-personality-test">Truity.com</a>
          </p>
					<p>The Big Five assessment measures scores based on five core aspects of personality: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism.</p>
          <img src="OCEAN.png" alt="OCEAN Scores" class="wide">
          <p>The high Openness level indicates a tendency to think in more abstract and complex ways, with an interest in art and culture. This score appears to support some of what was indicated in the Myers-Briggs type.</p>
          <p>A low score in Conscientiousness implies that organisation and discipline are areas in need of work. It would be in my interest to focus on improving these skills and practices.</p>
          <p>Low Extraversion suggests that I am less driven by the acknowledgement and attention of others, but more so my own passions and interests.</p>
          <p>Above average Agreeableness relates to empathy and tendencies of putting the needs of others first, usually being trusting and forgiving.</p>
          <p>The concerningly high level of Neuroticism is an indication that I am particularly prone to experiencing negative emotions. Like an overactive alarm system, I am more inclined to be too worried about getting something done than not worried enough.</p>

				<h1>Project Idea</h1>
			</div>

			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>
            The best way I can think to describe my idea would be to say that it is a social media platform that instead of tricking people into giving away their data for business purposes, turns that data into something useful for the consumer.
            A way for people to meet others of similar interests, in similar areas, take part in online discussions, discover new interests based on what they or people like them enjoy, all using the power of data analysis and metadata to directly help the consumer without any trickery or feelings of being manipulated or taken advantage of.
          </p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Motivation</h2>
					<p>
            The idea began with my realisation that I would love to make more friends who are interested in the same kinds of things I am, people to play games with or talk about movies and shows with.
            At this point the likes of Reddit would be the closest thing to a platform which satisfies that but trying to find people to meet up with and become close friends with through a site like that is not feasible, that is not what it was built for.
            What brought my idea to where it is was the realisation that a lot of us have data collected and used behind the scenes in ways that we are often unaware or suspicious of, and I think those methods could be used in a more honest and user-friendly way.
          </p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>
            There are many aspects to this idea that would each be different features of the service, but most follow the theme of using data to help people connect with others in a world where it can be so difficult sometimes to find like-minded individuals.
            In that sense, part of the site could follow a similar structure to dating services, though focused instead on meeting people with mutual interests in the area.
            For the people who feel that it is becoming difficult to make new friends in an increasingly online world, it would become as simple as putting your city and some interests into your profile and seeing who matches up most.
            Or if you are specifically looking for someone to play a game with, you could search for people in the area who like that same thing, sorted by how similar your other interests are or how close-by they could be.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another aspect I believe would be useful and simple to include on a platform of this kind would be a way to find suggestions for movies, games, or music to check out.
            When it feels like you have run out of things to do, hop on the site and see what other people with similar interests also enjoy, there could be a section for exploring what you might like, a catalogue of things your friends and people like you have enjoyed that you never got around to exploring.
            If this kind of project were to become big enough, users could link their streaming services to easily provide information about what they like and on a large enough scale it could be as simple as linking your accounts and immediately finding plenty of suggestions to check out and like-minded people to get to know.
          </p>
          <p>
            From a business perspective, the model is to shift the consumer’s perception of data and help them see how it can be used for their benefit.
            Having consumers consciously and actively seeking out new music, movies, shows, whatever it might be.
            Instead of advertising being perceived as targeted and forced attempts at monetising the users, we would turn the process on its head into a service being offered to consumers who are already there to find something new.
          </p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
					<p>On a large scale it would require many large servers and databases, but for a small working model of part of the idea, some databases with SQL linking into a site where one can make an account and include some data that can be used in algorithms to create suggestions for interests and friends should be enough for a start and a small proof of at least the base concept.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Skills Required</h2>
					<p>The skills required for this project depend on how much it scaled, for the initial model it should only take some HTML, CSS, JS, SQL, and a way to host the site and data.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Outcome</h2>
					<p>
            This project could help link people to potential friends but also help them find music, movies, shows, games, whatever it is they like to do, it could help them to find similar products they might not have otherwise known about or thought about looking into.
            Even just for improving the public perceptions of data it could help our transition into a data-based world feel like something to serve the consumers instead of just for profit.
            I know I personally would love if there was a service like this in full scale.
